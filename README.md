# tcs3200-color-detector-uart
This repository contains the Verilog design and simulation files for a Bluetooth-Operated Color Detection System as part of IITISoC'25. The system utilizes a TCS3200 color sensor to detect object colors and transmits the detected color information via UART, simulating communication with a Bluetooth module. The entire design is validated through simulation in Vivado.
